# Pomodoro (25 + 5 Clock) | Free Code Camp Project

[freeCodeCamp's project instructions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock)  
[Live version of my solution](https://athenascode.github.io/pomodoro/)

This was an early project I started while learning React. I revisited it several months later to update the styling and functionality. Ideally one day I will revisit this again to refactor and improve the code, but for now I am focusing on branching out from web development and React and working on other projects.

Deployed with [gh-pages package](https://blog.logrocket.com/deploying-react-apps-github-pages/).
